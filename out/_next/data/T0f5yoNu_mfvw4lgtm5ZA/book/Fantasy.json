A country that no star illuminates with its light, and the Sun does not warm with its rays. The inhabitants here do not need light. And all that the eyes of a lost traveler can distinguish with the help of a torchlight is his death reflected in the reflection of metal or the smile of someone's fangs... The Underdark is the domain of darkness, silence and death...And one of these possessions are the centers of life - cities that are not inferior in their grandeur, beauty and size to their terrestrial 'brothers'. And behind one of the countless turns of the tunnel, the traveler may stumble upon such a city ...Welcome to our hearth of life! Welcome to Menzoberranzan, traveler! And don't look at me with those eyes, it's my dagger stuck between your ribs. You've been warned, all you'll find here is death. And the last thing you'll see is a beautiful drow smile! And now the time of darkness and silence has come... In the name of Lolth, the Spider Queen!"},"similarBooks":[{"link":"AmericanGods","poster":"https://s1.livelib.ru/boocover/1000325896/200/334f/boocover.jpg","title":"American Gods","subtitle":"Neil Gaiman"},{"link":"Neverwhere","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41fC-yQ6-fL.jpg","title":"Neverwhere","subtitle":"Neil Gaiman"},{"link":"Sojourn","poster":"https://fantlab.ru/images/editions/big/2129?r=1492543035","title":"Sojourn","subtitle":"Robert A.
