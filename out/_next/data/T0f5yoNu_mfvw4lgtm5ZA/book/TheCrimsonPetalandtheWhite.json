At the center of this 'melodrama without melodrama' is the young woman's desire not to be a commodity, to wrest her body and soul from the slums. We get up close and personal with the heir to a prosperous perfume business, William Rackham, and his innocent, fragile wife Agnes, his 'hidden' daughter Sophie, and pious brother Henry, tormented by the conflict between the worldly and the sinless. We will also meet erudite libertines, self-serving servants, homeless children, street girls, Salvation Society reformers. Michel Faber started Petal as a student and rewrote it three times over the course of twenty years. This voluminous, Dickensian scale novel is a lively, colorful, even whimsical story about people, prejudices, prohibitions, customs and customs of nineteenth century England. Other than that, it's just an incredibly entertaining read.&nbsp;</p>\n","rating":8.33,"id":"TheCrimsonPetalandtheWhite"},"similarBooks":[{"link":"TheThornBirds","poster":"https://img-gorod.ru/24/746/2474600_detail.jpg","title":"The Thorn Birds","subtitle":"Colleen McCullough"},{"link":"MartinEden","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Z1pStyLKL.jpg","title":"Martin Eden","subtitle":"Jack London"},{"link":"f183322b931a","poster":"https://anylang.net/sites/default/files/covers/il-nome-della-rosa.jpg","title":"Il nome della rosa","subtitle":"Umberto Eco"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
